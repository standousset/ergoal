# Ergoa-L layout

Ergoa-L is a slight, and totally subjective, variation of the fantastic [Ergo-L layout]([https://duckduckgo.com](https://ergol.org/))

Kalamine-generated drivers (regular, mac, anglemod) can be found in Github actions’ artifacts.

## Why modify Ergo-L ?

Short-answer : I use 3x5 keyboards with the [Arsenik](https://ergol.org/claviers/arsenik/) approach.

1. Some characters like «, », € were not reachable.
2. Some non-French, non-English characters were useless to me. A cleaner “cavalier” is easier to learn too.
3. I replaced some typographic characters I was not using with ones I was using.
4. I wanted / to be directly reachable because many sites (like Github) use it for launching a search and when / is reached via a modifier or the dead key, it’s not working.

## Why 4 types of drivers ?

As you can see in the .toml files, macOS exchanges the place of the ISO key so another driver for macOS is necessary.
The other two come are angle mod variations.
